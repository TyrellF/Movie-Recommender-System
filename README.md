## Project Overview

This Movie Recommendation System is a dynamic web application that uses Machine Learning, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript to provide personalized movie recommendations. It has been integrated with Streamlit for an interactive user experience and deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access. The system was developed using Anaconda and Jupyter for data preprocessing and algorithm implementation.

## Features

- Machine Learning-based movie recommendation system.
- User-friendly web interface built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
- Interactive user experience powered by Streamlit.
- Data preprocessing and algorithm implementation in Jupyter notebooks using Anaconda.
- Cloud deployment for easy access.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (recommended: Python 3.x)
- Anaconda (for data preprocessing)
- Jupyter Notebook (for algorithm implementation)
- Streamlit (for web application)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge (for web development)
- Access to Streamlit Cloud for deployment

## Usage

1. Data Preprocessing: Use Jupyter notebooks within Anaconda to preprocess your data. This may include data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training. Save the necessary data files and trained models.

2. Web Development: Customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to match your project's design and user interface.

3. Algorithm Implementation: Implement your movie recommendation algorithm in a Jupyter notebook, and save the necessary files.

4. Integration with Streamlit: Use Streamlit to create an interactive web application. You can integrate your preprocessed data and recommendation algorithm into your Streamlit application.

5. Deployment: Deploy your Streamlit application to Streamlit Cloud or any other hosting service of your choice.

6. User Interaction: Users can now visit the deployed application and receive personalized movie recommendations.
